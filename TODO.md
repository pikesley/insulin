* Default 'day' for executable doesn't make much sense
* Indexes
* Map/reduce somewhere?
* Jenkins?
* Food - combine available carbs data with meds object? or other way around?
* Estimated HbA1c?
* Have week and month options which default to the last week, last 30 days
 * This is a bit broken: it zooms off into the future, and also the default 'last week' option does the previous 6 days but not today!
 * or maybe a general "set of days" class which generalises to week, month, whatever
