* Executable needs to handle config somehow (~/.insulinrc maybe)
* Indexes
* Map/reduce somewhere?
* Jenkins?
* Food - combine available carbs data with meds object? or other way around?
* Unhappy with event display from Day. Maybe just make these things fixed-width and move this into Event (which should have a variety of to_s-ish methods, including as_csv which takes a list of fields)
