* Default 'day' for executable doesn't make much sense
* Indexes
* Map/reduce somewhere?
* Jenkins?
* Food - combine available carbs data with meds object? or other way around?
* Estimated HbA1c?
* https://github.com/svenfuchs/gem-release - put these into rake tasks?
* empty time periods should return "nothing known" 
* https://github.com/prawnpdf/prawn
* Fully detailed output showing latest HbA1c, BP, etc
* Work out Google Drive API
* Write some proper rubydocs
* Should not include HbA1c or BP in normal output. Also, these things need units. And BP is not really a number.
* Remove TZ from normal output
* Number of tests &c per time period
* Update test data to include HbA1c and BP
* Somehow include cholesterol
* Test the insulin executable
