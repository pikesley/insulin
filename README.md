What's this?
============

Well I was recently diagnosed with Type-1 Diabetes. I've been collecting lots of data related to my condiiton using [OnTrack](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gexperts.ontrack), and wanted to do more interesting things with it. Hence this.

At the moment there are just a few base classes here, the aim is to have it at the very least able to export custom CSV files for spreadsheet/graphing purposes.
